          <h3>Manifesto</h3>

          <p>How did we get here?  Many years of government abuse trickling down to the people. We must bear the brunt of the financial follies created intentionally and unintentionally.</p>

          <p>The most recent of these follies stems from the COVID-19 pandemic that forced you and your loved ones inside, unable to develop financial stability to provide for yourself or your family.</p>

          <p>The government stood idly by while millions of hardworking individuals suffered.</p>
          
          <p><b>All the while, the rich got richer.</b></p>

          <blockquote>Billionaires got <span>54% richer</span> during pandemic, sparking calls for &apos;wealth tax&apos;<hr/>The world&apos;s 2,365 billionaires enjoyed a <span>$4 trillion</span> boost to their fortunes the past 12 months, even as poverty surged.</blockquote>

      <div className={styles.manifoot}>
        <p>These billionaires could care less about you; their bottom line is their only concern; they will outsource your work to the lowest bidder, making your jobs obsolete.</p> 

        <p>Why can&apos;t Apple be manufactured in the US? Simple, it isn&apos;t profitable. &quot;LEARN TO CODE,&quot; they said. Let&apos;s learn to produce our form of currency that true believers have faith in.</p> 

        <p>Let us rise above the financial norms and standards set since childhood and break free from the chains of fiat currency. This movement is worldwide; we can shape our future for the betterment of society.</p>
        
        <blockquote><big>We believe that there is a path forward. It requires us ALL to cause a little bit of anarchy. We must be vigilant in our mission; we must trust the process.<br/><br/>Join our DAO. We would love to hear from you.</big></blockquote>
